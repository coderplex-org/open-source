### Details 
#### Mentorship
Through this initative, if you are interested in participating in Hacktoberfest, you will receive guidance and support from mentors in 
the ecosystem, who activly contribute to a specific open source projects. 

If you would like to be a mentor for this program, i.e if you actively contribute to a Open Source project, or if you actively build and manage a Open Source project created by you, then we encourage you to join our initiative as a mentor for said project. 

Our expectations from you would be : 
- Creating tutorials (blog or video) in which you guide people on how to contribute to said project
- Being available online for the rest of the month in the [Coderplex Community Chatroom](https://chat.coderplex.org) to answer any 
questions and provide support to anyone intersted in contributing to the project you are mentoring 
- If possible, being present at the offline event we will host this month, where contributors and mentors can come together to interact, 
ask questions, and help each other make their pull requests to the respective projects they are contributing

#### Tutorials 
Through this initative, we'll be creating online resources in text and video format, that will help beginners learn the basics of 
contributing to Open Source projects, for examples how to use Git and GitHub, and we'll also work with the mentors in our program 
to create tutorials on how to contribute to the open source projects they are mentoring for

#### Offline Event 
Towards the end of this month, we'll most likely be hosting a offline meetup where both the mentors and the contributors can come down to 
interact, to receive and to provide help to others in making their contributions for Hacktoberfest
